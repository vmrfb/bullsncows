# Bulls & Cows Android

## Summary
A little well-known logical game, Bulls & Cows, reimagined for Android. Vibe-coded in Cursor and manually built in Android Studio. Try to build it and deploy to your Android device!
**Supported languages:** Russian, Portuguese, Suomi, English.

## Coding
- Developed using the default Claude Sonnet 3.5 model with Agent mode.
- All images and graphics are generated by the GPT-4o model in ChatGPT, with no references to external resources.

## Implementation Process

The development journey included several key phases and challenges:

1. **Initial Project Generation & Prototype**
   - Generated the initial Android project and a simple playable prototype.
   - Fixed Gradle build issues to ensure the project could be built and run in Android Studio.

2. **Feature Requests & Style Improvements**

   - **UI/UX Enhancements**
     - Improved the main game layout for both portrait and landscape orientations.
     - Split the input and attempts list in landscape mode for better usability.
     - Added a visually appealing congratulations dialog with a custom background and happy cows image.
     - Made the congratulations dialog scrollable and ensured input fields are always visible, even in landscape mode.
     - Redesigned the toolbar to include a subtitle and ensured icons are vertically centered.
     - Added a game header to the toolbar for better context.

   - **Localization & Internationalization**
     - Added support for four languages: Russian, Portuguese, Finnish and English.
     - Ensured all string resources are present and properly translated in all supported languages.
     - Made the help guide and all dialogs fully localized.
     - Fixed issues with language switching so that the UI updates immediately and correctly.

   - **Game Logic & State Management**
     - Fixed the animation logic for bulls and cows to use the actual screen width and a "salute" effect.
     - Prevented a new game from starting on orientation change by persisting game state.
     - Made the congratulations dialog persistent across orientation changes.
     - Ensured the input field is validated and limited to 4 unique digits, with no leading zero.

   - **Resource & Build Improvements**
     - Renamed image resources to avoid invalid names (e.g., removed hyphens).
     - Cleaned up duplicate and missing string definitions.
     - Updated `.gitignore` to exclude build outputs, binaries, and OS-specific files.
     - Ensured all images are original and generated by AI, with no external references.

   - **Testing & Debugging**
     - Added a temporary test button to the toolbar for showing the congratulations dialog (later removed).
     - Used Logcat and Android Studio tools for debugging build and runtime issues.
     - Fixed crashes related to uninitialized managers and unresolved references.
     - Verified dialog and UI behavior across different devices and orientations.

3. **Bug Fixes & Testing**
   - Tackled tricky bugs, especially those related to resource linking, orientation changes, and dialog persistence.
   - Used Logcat and Android Studio's tools to debug build and runtime issues.
   - Ensured the app handled language switching and state restoration correctly.

4. **Final Touches & Polishing**
   - Applied final UI/UX tweaks, improved dialog scrollability, and ensured all features worked smoothly across devices and orientations.
   - Cleaned up resources, `.gitignore`, and project structure for public release.

## TODO
- Add a link to Google Play when published.
- Draft a guide for publishing to Google Play.
